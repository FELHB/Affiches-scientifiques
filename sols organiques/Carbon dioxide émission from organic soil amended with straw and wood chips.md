## Abstract (EN)

In Quebec, nearly 50% of vegetable crop production originates from organic soil.  
However, the drainage required to cultivate these soils induces soil loss of 1 to 5 cm yr⁻¹, which includes CO₂ emission due to peat decomposition.  
One conservation strategy explored is to add plant-based amendments to organic soil to compensate for carbon loss.  
However, little is known about the impact of this conservation strategy on CO₂ fluxes.

A greenhouse experiment was developed using soil columns (65 cm long, 25 cm inner diameter) filled with organic soils collected from southwestern Quebec.  
Treatment was assigned to each column in a full block factorial experiment.  
Four types of biomasses (birch, willow, panicum, and miscanthus) at 3 different rates (2%, 6%, 20% v/v) constituted the treatments, in addition to an intact control and a perturbed control without amendment.  
The fluxes of CO₂ emitted by soils were measured weekly with the static chamber method and infrared sensors over a period of 9 weeks, totaling 1228 degree-days.

Results showed that CO₂ emitted from the control soil columns (intact and perturbed) were 4.9 and 5.2 tC-CO₂/ha/year, respectively.  
For the 2% v/v biomass treatments, incorporated just before measurements, fluxes varied from 6.6 to 9.1 tC-CO₂/ha/year, showing a priming effect after biomass incorporation.  
Shrub biomass (birch and willow) had higher CO₂ emissions than grass biomass (panicum and miscanthus), with values of 6.5 to 9.1 tC-CO₂/ha/year compared to 5.9 to 6.7 tC-CO₂/ha/year.

Overall, CO₂ emissions depended on the type, the quantity, and the timing following biomass input.  
Although the addition of amendments stimulated mineralization, adding biomass above the priming effect will offset total carbon losses.  
This exploratory research should be completed by a longer-term field trial including repeated biomass additions to validate the results observed in this column experiment.
